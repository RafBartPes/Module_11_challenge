# Cryptocurrency Market Analysis

## Overview
This Python script analyzes cryptocurrency market data using clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. It aims to uncover patterns and relationships within the data to gain insights into the behavior of different cryptocurrencies in the market.

## Features
- **Data Loading:** Load market data from a CSV file and set the "coin_id" column as the index.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Normalize the data using StandardScaler from scikit-learn.
- **Clustering Analysis:** Use KMeans clustering to group cryptocurrencies based on their price change percentages.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data and visualize it in a lower-dimensional space.
- **Visualization:** Generate scatter plots to visualize clustering results and PCA components.

## Usage
1. Run the script `crypto_analysis.py`.
2. The script will load the market data from a CSV file (`crypto_market_data.csv`) and preprocess it.
3. It will then perform KMeans clustering to group cryptocurrencies based on their price change percentages.
4. The script will use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data and visualize it in a lower-dimensional space.
5. Finally, it will generate scatter plots to visualize the clustering results and PCA components.

## Results
- The script provides insights into the clusters of cryptocurrencies based on their price change percentages.
- It also visualizes the data in a lower-dimensional space using PCA, helping to identify patterns and relationships.

## Customization
- You can customize the script by adjusting the number of clusters in the KMeans algorithm or changing the number of components in the PCA analysis.
- Additionally, you can modify the visualization code to create different types of plots or enhance the existing ones.
